**_I am an aspiring Backend Engineer_** currently enhancing my skills through a Full-stack Software Engineering Bootcamp at RevoU, where I have learned **_Python programming, RESTful API design, and database management with MySQL and MongoDB._** My background in Industrial Engineering has strengthened my **_analytical and strategic thinking skills_**, further enhancing my **_problem-solving abilities_**. As a Fulfillment Planner, I fulfilled demand and ensured timely deliveries to retail partners as well as distribution centers, coordinating logistics to maintain efficiency in the supply chain. This experience highlighted the importance of **_collaboration and effective communication_**. At RevoU, I contributed to developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an e-commerce platform by integrating several APIs. I am actively **_expanding my expertise in Go_** to tackle complex backend challenges. My goal is to become a skilled Backend Engineer, leveraging my technical knowledge and innovative mindset to drive organizational growth through impactful software solutions.

PDC Recycle is an e-commerce platform focused on recycled products. As the backend developer, I created a Flask-based API to support essential e-commerce functionalities. The project integrates several third-party services to handle payments, shipping calculations, and image storage, all deployed on AWS infrastructure

#### Key Features:

-   **User Authentication**: Implemented JWT-based authentication for secure user management.
-   **Product Management**: Developed CRUD Operations for product listings, integrating Cloudinary for image handling.
-   **Order Processing**: Created a system for managing the full order lifecycle, including integration with Midtrans for payment processing and automatic payment notification.
-   **Shipping Integration**: Incorporated RajaOngkir API for real-time shipping cost calculations across multiple courier services.
-   **Database Management**: Designed MySQL database schema, hosted on AWS RDS
-   **Deployment**: Configured and deployed the application on AWS EC2, ensuring security best practices.
